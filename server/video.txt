Hi.
My name is Vladyslav and I would like to introduce "GlobalLogic Live" project as part of the POC initiative.

#globe
In nutshell, GLLive aims to present company as solid structure or, if you want, like a living organism.
We want to collect and broadcast as more data as we can for company employees.

# news screen
There are two main parts of the project.
First is an news scaner. One page dashboard should hightlight company from different perspectives at the same time.
We plan to use all possible sources like facebook, twitter, bloomberg and other.

The second part displays aggregated statistics for the company around the globe.
We want to gether numbers about sales, engineers, employees, vacancies, projects, relations between different offices and so on.
You can think of it like as number of hyperplanes that allow observe company from different sides.

Technically, project is based on web stack: Apache, PHP, HTML, WebGL and Java script.
It also uses public APIs and security access to the internal systems.

Behind the scene, GLLIve is initial Big Data Analysis for Global Logic infractucture.
The key idea is to put together data from different sources like GLO, local portals, HR, IT etc.
Also system should collect information in real time or near to real time.

As a first step, project could be used at the ofice reception or like a screensaver.
