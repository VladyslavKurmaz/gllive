Hi. My name is vladyslav and I would like to introduce "GlobalLogic Live" project as part of the POC initiative.

In nutshell, GLLive aims to present company as solid structure or, if you want, like living organism.

There are two main parts.
First one is about news feed. Open page should provide company overview from global and local perspectives at the same time.
The second part displays aggregated statistics about the company around the globe.

Behind the scene, GLLIve is initial Big Data Analysis for Global Logic infractucture.
The key idea is to put together data from different sources like GLO, local portals, HR & IT departments etc.


real time or near to real time
